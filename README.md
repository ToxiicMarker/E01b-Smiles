Discription
This excercise has taught me how to create a smiley face using python arcade. This exercise has taught me how to instal python arcade. This excercise has shown me that I also know next to nothing about how python works as I looked at main5 and I could not imagine creating that code myself. (One day perhaps, haha) I hope that by the end of the semmester of CS and programing I will be able to create somehting like main5. This code also taught me about using a GUI as I had to set the size of the window.  This excercise also taught me tricks to setting the positions of the shapes used to create an image, as well as setting the color of shapes from a color utility such as open_color. 

I completed the assignment at the library computer lab right after we were assigned the assignment, however I just discovered that I did not succssfully push my work to GitHub. I just recompleted the assignment on my laptop, but I could not get pip installed so I was unable to see my smiley faces. I understand the purpose of the assignment and learned how to use the image creation tool with python arcade. I apollogize if my smiley faces are not perfect as I just went off the cordinates I used in main1.py.
